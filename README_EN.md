Currently, it's a UWP version of Todo Manager & Backup Manager. And I feel glad to bring multilingual support to this project.

## Brief Introduction

Another project of reinventing the wheel ü§£ But it feels comfortable (mainly because it looks good) to use something you've built yourself. I just like the feeling of making whatever I need üòâ For now, the functionality is limited, but I'll continue updating it if I come up with more ideas.
